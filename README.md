# matrix
Geometry module. All the maths, geometry & trigonometry (2D/3D) functions I need for my projects.

## Installation
```
pip install noise
python setup.py
```

## Examples
Here is a list of *some* of my projects that use the matrix module (all might not be public anymore):
 * Toeplitz Conjecture visulatization
 * [Chaikin3D](https://github.com/Nicolas-Reyland/Chaikin3D)
 * Physics Paper Fall simulation
 * Blackhole light attraction simulation
 * 2D ray marching / 2D ray tracing
 * [Marching Cubes algorithm](https://github.com/Nicolas-Reyland/Marching-Cubes)
 * [Rubik's Cube Solving wtih OpenGL](https://github.com/Nicolas-Reyland/Rubik-s-Cube-OpenGL) (has it's own implementation of the matrix module)
